What is a leap year?

A leap year is a year with 366 days instead of 365 in the Gregorian calendar. This extra day (leap day) is obtained by adding February 29 to February, which normally has 28 days.

How is a leap year calculated?

As a general rule, leap years are years that are multiples of 4:

1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, etc.
Of the years that are multiples of 100, only those that are divisible by 400 without remainders are leap years:

For example, 1200, 1600, 2000 are leap years, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 are not leap years.
The reason why only those that are exactly divisible by 400 are considered leap years is to eliminate the error that an astronomical year is not 365.25 days, but approximately 365.242 days.
